This is an sorting algorithm simulator that visualizes how a sorting algorithm sorts through an
array.
There are 5 different algorithm to choose from:
  - Bubble sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Radix sort
  - Merge sort
  - Quick sort

Start program by starting a server in Menu.js.

To start the sorting simply click on one of the boxes that contains the name of a sorting algorithm,
then click the "Start/Stop" button.

Button function:
- "Start/Stop" ~ start or stop the sorting process at any time by clicking on the corresponding
                 button.
- "Randomize"  ~ randomize the array.
- There are a couple of colored themes to choose from on the right side including:
  - "Teal Blue", which is the original color of the lines.
  - "Black & White", which shows a gradient from black to white.
  - "RGB", which is red, green, and blue themed.



New things that I learned with this project
  - How to use p5.js.
  - Basics to JavaScript
  - Using asynchronous function to deal with recursive functions
      â€¢ keywords: async, wait, Promise
  - Connecting the interactive user interface to functioning code that relates to the action

To enhance this project in the future, consider adding to the following:
  - Change the "RGB" button to a rainbow gradient. Initially, the "RBG" button was supposed to
    display a rainbow-themed sorted array. However, after printing out the values and trying to
    debug I am not exactly sure what how to solve this problem.
  - When changing from a sorting algorithm that uses recursion (Merge and Quick sort) to a different
    algorithm, a bug occurs where the newly selected algorithm doesn't start.
